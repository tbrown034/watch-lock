# Profile Page Refactor - Component Breakdown

**Date:** 2025-01-20
**Goal:** Break up the long profile page into focused, reusable components

---

## What Was Done

Refactored `app/profile/page.tsx` (533 lines) into 5 smaller, focused components.

---

## New Components Created

### 1. **ProfileHeader.tsx** (Client Component)
**Location:** `components/profile/ProfileHeader.tsx`
**Responsibility:** Display user avatar, name, and email with inline editing

**Features:**
- Display name editing with validation
- Real-time save/cancel functionality
- Error handling
- Dispatches 'profileUpdated' event for AuthHeader

**Props:**
```typescript
{
  user: User;
  profile: Profile;
  onProfileUpdate: (profile: Profile) => void;
}
```

---

### 2. **QuickActions.tsx** (Client Component)
**Location:** `components/profile/QuickActions.tsx`
**Responsibility:** Action buttons for common tasks

**Features:**
- "View Today's Games" link
- "Join a Room" button

**Props:**
```typescript
{
  onJoinRoom: () => void;
}
```

---

### 3. **AccountInfo.tsx** (Server Component)
**Location:** `components/profile/AccountInfo.tsx`
**Responsibility:** Display read-only account information

**Features:**
- Email address display
- Member since date
- No client-side features (could be Server Component in future)

**Props:**
```typescript
{
  user: User;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

---

### 4. **RoomsList.tsx** (Client Component)
**Location:** `components/profile/RoomsList.tsx`
**Responsibility:** Display user's rooms with actions

**Features:**
- Room cards with name, share code, member count
- "Enter Room" button (if gameId exists)
- "Share" button with modal
- "Delete" button (owners only)
- Share modal with copy-to-clipboard

**Props:**
```typescript
{
  rooms: Room[];
  onDeleteRoom: (roomId: string) => Promise<void>;
  deletingRoomId: string | null;
}
```

---

### 5. **SignOutButton.tsx** (Client Component)
**Location:** `components/profile/SignOutButton.tsx`
**Responsibility:** Sign out functionality

**Features:**
- Sign out button
- Handles sign out flow
- Redirects to home page

**Props:** None (self-contained)

---

## Refactored Profile Page

**Location:** `app/profile/page.tsx`
**New Length:** 198 lines (down from 533 lines)
**Reduction:** 63% smaller

**What it does now:**
- Fetches user, profile, and rooms data
- Manages auth check and redirect
- Handles delete room logic
- Composes the 5 components together

**Component structure:**
```tsx
<ProfilePage>
  <ProfileHeader /> {/* Edit name */}
  <QuickActions /> {/* View games, Join room */}
  <AccountInfo /> {/* Email, Member since */}
  <RoomsList /> {/* My Rooms with actions */}
  <SignOutButton /> {/* Sign out */}
  <RoomJoinModal /> {/* Join modal (conditional) */}
</ProfilePage>
```

---

## Benefits

### 1. **Better Organization**
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easier to understand what each piece does
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. **Reusability**
- `ProfileHeader` could be reused on other profile-related pages
- `SignOutButton` could be placed in a settings menu
- `AccountInfo` could be used in admin dashboards

### 3. **Easier Testing**
- Each component can be tested independently
- Smaller surface area for bugs
- Easier to mock props and test edge cases

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Changes to name editing only touch `ProfileHeader.tsx`
- Changes to room actions only touch `RoomsList.tsx`
- Less chance of breaking unrelated features

### 5. **Performance** (Future)
- `AccountInfo` could become a Server Component (static data)
- Smaller components = smaller bundle splits
- Easier to optimize individual pieces

## File Structure

```
components/
  profile/
    â”œâ”€â”€ ProfileHeader.tsx      (Client) - Name editing
    â”œâ”€â”€ QuickActions.tsx       (Client) - Action buttons
    â”œâ”€â”€ AccountInfo.tsx        (Client) - Account info display
    â”œâ”€â”€ RoomsList.tsx          (Client) - Rooms with actions
    â””â”€â”€ SignOutButton.tsx      (Client) - Sign out

app/
  profile/
    â””â”€â”€ page.tsx               (Client) - Main page orchestrator
```

---

## Component Responsibilities

| Component | Lines | Client Features | Could Be Server? |
|-----------|-------|----------------|------------------|
| ProfileHeader | ~150 | useState, form handling | No (interactive) |
| QuickActions | ~40 | onClick handler | No (button click) |
| AccountInfo | ~45 | None | **Yes** (static display) |
| RoomsList | ~160 | useState, modal, clipboard | No (interactive) |
| SignOutButton | ~30 | onClick, router | No (auth action) |
| **Profile Page** | ~200 | useEffect, data fetching | No (orchestrator) |

---

## Future Optimizations

### 1. Convert AccountInfo to Server Component
Currently it's a Client Component in a Client Page. If we convert the profile page to a Server Component (future task), `AccountInfo` could be pure server-rendered.

### 2. Extract Share Modal
The share modal in `RoomsList` could be extracted to its own component:
```
components/room/ShareModal.tsx
```

### 3. Create Shared Types File
Profile and Room interfaces are duplicated. Could extract to:
```
types/profile.ts
types/room.ts
```

## Summary

**Before:**
- 1 massive file (533 lines)
- Hard to navigate
- Mixed concerns
- Difficult to test

**After:**
- 6 focused files (~90 lines each average)
- Easy to navigate
- Clear responsibilities
- Easy to test

**Result:** Clean, maintainable, professional codebase structure! ðŸŽ‰
