# Watch-Lock Auth & Database Cleanup - Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-20
**Completed By:** Claude Code (Anthropic)

---

## What Was Done

This cleanup refactored the entire authentication and database implementation to follow Supabase official best practices for Next.js 15 App Router with SSR.

### 1. ‚úÖ Created Clean Schema Migration

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250120000000_clean_schema_reset.sql`

**Changes:**
- Dropped ALL existing policies (clean slate)
- Recreated all 6 tables with proper relationships
- Fixed schema: `games ‚Üê rooms` (one-to-many, NOT bidirectional)
- Removed deprecated `username` field (uses `display_name` only)
- Created simple RLS policies without infinite recursion
- Updated triggers to match new schema
- Comprehensive inline documentation

**Tables:**
1. `profiles` - User data (extends auth.users)
2. `games` - Sporting events (MLB/NFL)
3. `rooms` - Watch parties for games
4. `room_members` - Junction table
5. `progress_markers` - User positions in games
6. `messages` - Spoiler-locked chat

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Updated Supabase Client Files

All three client files now have comprehensive documentation following official Supabase patterns:

**lib/supabase/client.ts**
- Browser client for Client Components
- Documented with usage examples
- Follows official `createBrowserClient` pattern

**lib/supabase/server.ts**
- Server client for Server Components, API Routes, Server Actions
- Documented critical `await cookies()` pattern
- Explains why this opts out of Next.js caching

**lib/supabase/admin.ts**
- Admin client with service_role key
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Clear warnings about bypassing RLS
- Documented when to use and when NOT to use
- Example code showing safe pattern

**middleware.ts**
- Comprehensive documentation of auth refresh flow
- Explains PKCE flow and cookie management
- Clarifies why this is REQUIRED for SSR

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Updated API Routes with Clear Documentation

**app/api/rooms/create/route.ts**
- Added comprehensive header documentation
- Documented request/response formats
- Explained the "How It Works" flow
- Clarified why admin client is used

**app/api/games/[id]/messages/route.ts**
- Documented both GET and POST endpoints
- Explained why manual auth checks are needed (better error messages)
- Documented spoiler filter mechanism
- Request/response examples

**app/api/games/[id]/state/route.ts**
- **Clarified it's intentionally public**
- Explained WHY it's public (proxies public MLB/NFL data)
- Documented that it does NOT expose user data
- Request/response examples for both MLB and NFL

---

**File:** `AUTH_RULES.md` (completely rewritten)

**Sections:**
1. **Architecture Overview** - Tech stack, relationships, key concepts
2. **Database Schema** - All 6 tables with SQL, triggers, constraints
3. **Supabase Client Setup** - Environment variables, client files, middleware

8. **Security Best Practices** - ‚úÖ DO and ‚ùå DON'T lists
9. **Common Patterns & Examples** - Code snippets for common tasks
10. **Migration Instructions** - How to apply the clean schema
11. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and fixes

**Length:** 771 lines of comprehensive documentation

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Created Migration Guide

**File:** `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

**Sections:**
- Overview of changes
- Pre-migration checklist (backup!)
- Two migration options (fresh start vs. preserve data)
- Post-migration verification (5 tests)

- ‚úÖ Auth flow is documented step-by-step
- ‚úÖ RLS policies explained with rationale
- ‚úÖ Common patterns have code examples
- ‚úÖ Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- ‚úÖ Migration guide with safety checklist

## Schema Changes Summary

### Old Schema (Problematic):
```
games.room_id ‚Üí rooms.id  ‚ùå Circular/confusing
profiles.username         ‚ùå Deprecated field
Multiple RLS policies     ‚ùå Infinite recursion issues
```

### New Schema (Clean):
```
games ‚Üê rooms.game_id     ‚úÖ Clear one-to-many
profiles.display_name     ‚úÖ Single name field
Simple RLS policies       ‚úÖ No recursion
```

### Relationship Model:
```
auth.users
    ‚Üì
profiles (1:1)
    ‚Üì
games (sporting events)
    ‚Üì
rooms (watch parties - many per game)
    ‚Üì
room_members (junction table)
    ‚Üì
progress_markers + messages
```

## Next Steps (For You)

### 1. Review the Changes
- [ ] Read `AUTH_RULES.md` thoroughly
- [ ] Review the migration file: `supabase/migrations/20250120000000_clean_schema_reset.sql`
- [ ] Check the updated client files
- [ ] Understand the new schema relationships

### 2. Apply the Migration

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Backup first!**

```bash
# Option 1: Via Supabase SQL Editor (recommended)
# 1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/msdemnzgwzaokzjyymgi/sql
# 2. Copy contents of supabase/migrations/20250120000000_clean_schema_reset.sql
# 3. Paste and run

# Option 2: Via Supabase CLI (if Docker running)
supabase db push
```

### 3. Test Everything

Follow the verification steps in `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`:
- [ ] Test user signup (profile auto-created)
- [ ] Test room creation (auto-added as owner)
- [ ] Test room joining (second user)
- [ ] Test RLS policies (can only see own rooms)
- [ ] Test spoiler filter (messages locked by position)

### 4. Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: clean auth and database refactor following Supabase official docs"
git push origin main
```

Then apply migration to production Supabase (after thorough testing in dev).

## Questions or Issues?

### Where to Look:
1. **Auth questions** ‚Üí `AUTH_RULES.md`
2. **Migration questions** ‚Üí `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
3. **RLS questions** ‚Üí `AUTH_RULES.md` (Row Level Security section)
4. **Troubleshooting** ‚Üí `AUTH_RULES.md` (Troubleshooting section)
5. **Examples** ‚Üí `AUTH_RULES.md` (Common Patterns section)

### Common Issues:
- **"Profile not created"** ‚Üí Check trigger exists (see MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- **"Infinite recursion"** ‚Üí Old policies still exist (see MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- **"RLS blocking queries"** ‚Üí Check user is room member (see AUTH_RULES.md)

## What Makes This "Simple and Following the Docs"

### 1. Direct Translation of Official Patterns
Every client file (`client.ts`, `server.ts`, `middleware.ts`) is copied almost verbatim from:
https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/nextjs

### 2. No Patchwork Fixes
Instead of layering migration on top of migration, we:
- Dropped ALL policies (clean slate)
- Recreated tables with correct relationships
- Applied simple, well-understood RLS patterns
- Used official Supabase patterns exclusively

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation
Every decision is documented:
- **Why** admin client is used
- **Why** game state endpoint is public
- **Why** manual auth checks exist
- **Why** policies are structured a certain way

### 4. Follows Single Source of Truth
All patterns come from ONE source: Official Supabase docs for Next.js 15 App Router
(Not mixing old patterns, not custom solutions, not Stack Overflow hacks)

### 5. Makes Sense to Humans
- Clear table relationships (games ‚Üê rooms)
- Obvious field names (display_name, not username)
- Documented rationale for every design choice
- Code examples for every pattern
- Troubleshooting for common issues
